Defining and Using Sets in Pseudocode

1. Type Definition:
   - First, you define the type of the set and the base type of its elements. In the example you provided, the set Sletter consists of characters.

   pseudocode
   TYPE Sletter = SET OF CHAR
   

2. Variable Definition:
   - Next, you define a variable of the type Sletter. The variable vowel is initialized with the elements 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

   pseudocode
   DEFINE vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') : Sletter
   

Set Operations

To expand on how you can use sets, here are examples of set operations:

- Union: Combines all elements from two sets, removing duplicates.
  pseudocode
  SET unionVowels = vowel UNION {'y'}
  

- Intersection: Finds common elements between two sets.
  pseudocode
  DEFINE set1 ('a', 'i', 'u') : Sletter
  DEFINE set2 ('i', 'o', 'u') : Sletter
  SET commonVowels = set1 INTERSECTION set2
  

- Difference: Returns elements present in one set but not in the other.
  pseudocode
  SET uniqueVowels = vowel DIFFERENCE {'a', 'e'}
  

These operations allow you to manipulate sets for various needs, such as filtering data or combining information from different sources. Sets, being inherently unordered and unique, are particularly useful in scenarios where the order of elements does not matter, and duplicates are not desired.
