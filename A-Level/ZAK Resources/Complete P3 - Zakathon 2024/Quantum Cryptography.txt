Quantum Cryptography:

1. Quantum Cryptography Basics:
   - It's a way to secure communications using the principles of quantum mechanics.
   - Unlike traditional cryptography, which uses math to encrypt messages, quantum cryptography uses the physical properties of particles like photons.

2. Key Principles of Quantum Mechanics:
   - Superposition: A particle can exist in multiple states at once.
   - Entanglement: Two particles can be linked so that the state of one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance.

3. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):
   - The most common use of quantum cryptography.
   - It lets two parties create a secret key for secure communication.
   - If someone tries to eavesdrop, the key's quantum state changes, alerting the parties.

4. Benefits:
   - Almost impossible to hack: Interception changes the key's state, revealing eavesdroppers.
   - Future-proof: Not reliant on complex math, so it's safe against advanced future computers.

5. Drawbacks:
   - Expensive and complex to implement.
   - Limited range: Effective only over certain distances.
   - Sensitive to environmental factors, requiring specialized equipment.
