Explanation and Pseudocode Examples for File Operations:

OPENFILE: Opens the file with the specified mode (READ or WRITE).
READ: Opens the file for reading data.
WRITE: Opens the file for writing data. Creates a new file, overwriting existing data.

Example:
OPENFILE "students.txt" FOR READ
OPENFILE "newStudents.txt" FOR WRITE

READFILE: Reads data from the opened file and assigns it to a variable.
Example for one field per line:

DECLARE StuID, StuName, StuClass, StuFee : STRING
READFILE students.txt, StuID
READFILE students.txt, StuName
READFILE students.txt, StuClass
READFILE students.txt, StuFee

//Record structure:
1
Zafar
OL-A
5263
2
Ahmed
OL-C
5000

WRITEFILE newStudents.txt, StuID
WRITEFILE newStudents.txt, StuName
WRITEFILE newStudents.txt, StuClass
WRITEFILE newStudents.txt, StuFee
--------------------------------------------------------

Example for merged fields per line (comma-separated):
DECLARE record, StuID, StuName, StuClass, StuFee : STRING
READFILE students.txt, record

//Record structure
record = "1,Zafar,OL-A,5263"
         "2,Ahmed,OL-C,5000"

//SPLIT record BY ',' INTO StuID, StuName, StuClass, StuFee
record = StuID + ',' + StuName + ',' + StuClass + ',' + StuFee
WRITEFILE newStudents.txt, record


CLOSEFILE: Closes the opened file, freeing up resources and saving changes.
Example:
CLOSEFILE students.txt
CLOSEFILE newStudents.txt

Remember to use loops when reading or writing multiple records. These examples demonstrate how to read and write single records in both one field per line and merged fields per line formats. For multiple records, simply incorporate loops to iterate through each record as needed.

complete example codes:
*Pseudocode Example 1: One Field per Line*

// Declare variables
DECLARE StuID, StuName, StuClass, StuFee, anotherStudent : STRING
DECLARE inputFile, outputFile : STRING

// Initialize file names
inputFile = "students.txt"
outputFile = "newStudents.txt"

// Open files
OPENFILE inputFile FOR READ
OPENFILE outputFile FOR WRITE

// Input, process, and output loop
REPEAT
  // Read fields from input file
  READFILE inputFile, StuID
  READFILE inputFile, StuName
  READFILE inputFile, StuClass
  READFILE inputFile, StuFee
  
  // Process fields (if necessary)
  
  // Write fields to output file
  WRITEFILE outputFile, StuID
  WRITEFILE outputFile, StuName
  WRITEFILE outputFile, StuClass
  WRITEFILE outputFile, StuFee
  
  // Check if there are more students
  PRINT "Is there another student? (Y/N)"
  INPUT anotherStudent
UNTIL anotherStudent = "N"

// Close files
CLOSEFILE inputFile
CLOSEFILE outputFile

Pseudocode Example 2: Combined Fields (comma-separated):
// Declare variables
DECLARE StuID, StuName, StuClass, StuFee, anotherStudent, record : STRING
DECLARE inputFile, outputFile : STRING

// Initialize file names
inputFile = "students.txt"
outputFile = "newStudents.txt"

// Open files
OPENFILE inputFile FOR READ
OPENFILE outputFile FOR WRITE

// Input, process, and output loop
REPEAT
  // Read record from input file
  READFILE inputFile, record
  
  // Split record into fields
  SPLIT record BY ',' INTO StuID, StuName, StuClass, StuFee
  
  // Process fields (if necessary)
  
  // Combine fields into record
  record = StuID + ',' + StuName + ',' + StuClass + ',' + StuFee
  
  // Write record to output file
  WRITEFILE outputFile, record
  
  // Check if there are more students
  PRINT "Is there another student? (Y/N)"
  INPUT anotherStudent
UNTIL anotherStudent = "N"

// Close files
CLOSEFILE inputFile
CLOSEFILE outputFile

------------------------------------------------------
These examples demonstrate how to read and write student records in both one field per line and combined fields per line (comma-separated) formats. The loops allow processing multiple records, and you can customize the process step as needed for your specific use case.
