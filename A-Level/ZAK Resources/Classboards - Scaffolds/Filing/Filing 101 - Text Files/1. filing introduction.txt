*Introducing File Concepts:*

A file refers to a digital entity used for storing various forms of data, including pictures, spreadsheets, or even executable programs.

These files are saved on secondary storage devices, like hard drives, external hard drives, CDs, USB flash drives, and so on.

When a file is created, it is given a name or <File identifier>, often accompanied by an extension that indicates the type of data it contains to both the computer and the user. For instance:

                 TextFile.txt   (contains textual data)
                 ImageFile.jpg  (contains visual data)
                 AudioFile.mp3  (contains music or sound data)
                 VideoFile.mpg  (contains video and audio data)

Technically, files can exist without extensions and still be accessible. However, if you attempt to open a file with an unknown format using an incompatible application, you'll only see unintelligible characters.

Numerous standard file formats exist. These formats, such as mp3, are widely used by a plethora of applications since their data structure is publicly accessible.

It's also possible to develop a unique file format with custom software and assign it a distinct extension, like:

                 UniqueFile.custom

The software that generated the UniqueFile.custom file formats the data according to its requirements.

In the subsequent pseudocodes, we will explore how programmers can open, close, read, and write files.
