Identifier Naming Conventions

Definition and General Rules
Identifiers are the names given to variables, arrays, constants, procedures, and functions in pseudocode. They follow specific naming conventions to ensure clarity and avoid conflicts.

Rules for Naming Identifiers
1. Mixed Case: Identifiers should be in mixed case (sometimes referred to as camelCase or PascalCase). This means that new words within the identifier should start with an uppercase letter.
   - Examples: NumberOfPlayers, firstName, totalAmount

2. Allowed Characters: Identifiers can contain letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). They must start with a letter and not a digit.
   - Valid: Player1, first_name, total_Amount
   - Invalid: 1stPlayer, total-Amount

3. No Accented Letters: Accented letters should not be used in identifiers.
   - Invalid: caféCount, élèveName

4. Descriptive Names: It is good practice to use identifier names that describe the variable, procedure, or function they refer to.
   - Examples: studentScore, calculateTotal, isEligible

5. Single Letters: Single letters may be used where conventional (such as i and j for array indices, or x and y for coordinates).
   - Examples: i, j, x, y

6. Keywords: Keywords identified elsewhere in the guide should never be used as variable names.
   - Invalid: IF, FOR, WHILE

7. Case Insensitivity: Identifiers should be considered case insensitive, meaning Countdown and CountDown should not be used as separate variable names.

Example Identifiers

Variables:
pseudocode
DECLARE playerName : STRING
DECLARE totalScore : INTEGER
DECLARE isEligible : BOOLEAN


Constants:
pseudocode
CONSTANT MaxPlayers = 4
CONSTANT DefaultScore = 0


Procedures and Functions:
pseudocode
PROCEDURE CalculateScore(playerName : STRING, score : INTEGER)
    // procedure code here
ENDPROCEDURE

FUNCTION GetPlayerName() RETURNS STRING
    RETURN "Player1"
ENDFUNCTION


Following these conventions ensures that the pseudocode is clear, understandable, and avoids conflicts with reserved keywords or improper syntax .
