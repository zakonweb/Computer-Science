Roles of input, output, primary memory, and secondary storage, including removable storage, is fundamental to comprehending how computers function. Each of these components plays a crucial role in the operation and utility of a computer system.

1. Input Devices
Input devices are used to enter data into a computer. They allow users to interact with and control the computer by providing the means to input commands and data. Common input devices include:
- Keyboard: For typing text and commands.
- Mouse: For pointing, clicking, and scrolling.
- Microphone: For entering sound.
- Scanner: For digitizing documents and images.
These devices are essential for users to communicate instructions to the computer, which processes the data.

2. Output Devices
Output devices are used to present information to the user in a expected or desired format. They display, project, or physically manifest data processed by the computer, making the results of computer processing useful to humans. Common output devices include:
- Monitor: Displays visual data, interfaces, and outputs from software applications.
- Printer: Produces a hard copy of digital documents.
- Speakers: Output sound from videos, music, and other audio files.
Output devices are crucial because they provide the means to retrieve and use the information processed by the computer.

3. Primary Memory (RAM)
Primary memory, or Random Access Memory (RAM), is the main memory used by a computer to store data temporarily while it is being used or processed. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off. Key aspects include:
- Speed: RAM operates at high speeds, allowing quick access to data and smooth functioning of applications.
- Function: It stores the operating system's active components, applications in use, and the data those applications are currently processing.
Primary memory is essential because it provides fast access to data that the CPU needs in real time.

4. Secondary Storage
Secondary storage refers to devices that store data permanently or semi-permanently. Unlike RAM, secondary storage retains data even when the computer is turned off. It includes:
- Hard Drives: The primary non-volatile storage used in computers for storing large amounts of data long-term.
- Solid State Drives (SSD): Faster than hard drives, SSDs use flash memory to store data, improving boot times and data access speeds.
Secondary storage is crucial for long-term data retention, providing a way to keep large volumes of data that are not currently in use but need to be kept accessible and safe.

5. Removable Storage
Removable storage allows for data to be easily transferred between devices or carried off-site for security or portability reasons. Examples include:
- USB Flash Drives: Small, portable flash memory devices.
- External Hard Drives: Larger capacity than flash drives, suitable for backups and large file storage.
- SD Cards: Commonly used in cameras, smartphones, and as a medium for transferring data between devices.
Removable storage is particularly valuable for data backup, sharing, and portability.

Summary
Together, these components enable a computer to function effectively by allowing it to receive data (input), process data (using primary memory and the CPU), store data (secondary and removable storage), and output results to the user. Each component has a specific role that supports the overall functionality and usability of a computer system. Understanding these roles can help you appreciate the interdependent nature of these technological tools in managing and processing information.
