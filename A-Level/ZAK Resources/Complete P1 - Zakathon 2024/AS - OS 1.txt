The OS is essential because it manages hardware resources, coordinates and executes software, and ensures system stability and security, allowing users and applications to interact with the computer efficiently.

Here are the key management tasks carried out by an Operating System (OS):

1. Memory Management: Allocates and manages RAM among processes, ensures efficient memory usage, and handles swapping between RAM and storage.

2. File Management: Controls the reading, writing, creation, and deletion of files. Manages directories and handles access permissions and file system organization.

3. Security Management: Protects system integrity and data security through user authentication, access rights enforcement, and use of security protocols.

4. Hardware Management: Manages input/output operations and peripheral devices, ensuring smooth operation and interfacing of components like disks, printers, and keyboards.

5. Process Management: Handles process scheduling, execution, and termination. Manages CPU time allocation among processes and ensures efficient process cooperation and competition for resources.
