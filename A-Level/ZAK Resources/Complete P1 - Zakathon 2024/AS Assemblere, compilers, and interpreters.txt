The need for assembler software, compilers, and interpreters arises from the fundamental requirement to translate human-readable programming instructions into machine code that a computer's processor can execute. Each of these translation tools serves a unique purpose in the software development process, targeting different programming languages and execution models.

Assembler Software
Assembler software is used to translate assembly language programs, which are low-level programming languages that are just a step above machine code. Assembly language provides symbolic representations of machine instructions and data, which are specific to the architecture of the computer's processor. The assembler converts these symbolic representations into the binary machine code that the processor can execute directly.

Benefits:
- Efficiency and Control: Allows programmers to write highly efficient and optimized code, offering direct control over hardware resources.
- System-Level Programming: Essential for writing system software, like operating system kernels and device drivers, where hardware interaction is critical.

Drawbacks:
- Complexity: Writing code in assembly language is time-consuming and prone to errors due to its low-level nature.
- Portability: Assembly language programs are processor-specific, making them non-portable across different hardware architectures.

Compiler
A compiler is a tool that translates programs written in a high-level programming language (like C, C++, or Java) into machine code or intermediate code that can be executed by the computer's processor. The compilation process involves several stages, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

Benefits:
- Performance: Compilers can optimize the code during the translation, leading to faster execution times for the compiled programs.
- Error Checking: Compilers perform thorough checks during the compilation process, catching syntax and some semantic errors before execution.

Drawbacks:
- Compilation Time: The process of compiling a program can be time-consuming, especially for large projects, delaying testing and debugging.
- Platform Dependency: Compiled binaries are typically specific to a particular operating system and hardware architecture, requiring recompilation for different platforms.

Interpreter
An interpreter directly executes instructions written in a high-level programming language without previously compiling them into machine code. It reads the source code line by line, translating it into machine code on the fly during execution.

Benefits:
- Ease of Use: Interpreters facilitate rapid development and testing cycles since there's no need to compile the code before running. This makes them ideal for scripting and prototyping.
- Portability: Since the source code is directly executed by the interpreter, it can run on any platform where the interpreter is available, enhancing code portability.

Drawbacks:
- Performance: Interpreted programs generally run slower than compiled ones because translation happens at runtime.
- Limited Error Detection Before Runtime: Errors are often caught only when the problematic line of code is executed, which can make debugging harder.

Justification for Use
The choice between using a compiler or an interpreter depends on several factors, including the requirements of the project, the programming language used, and the desired balance between development speed and program performance.

- Compilers are justified for projects where performance is critical, and the codebase is relatively stable, making the longer compilation times acceptable. They are also necessary when developing system-level software or applications where execution speed and optimization are crucial.

- Interpreters are more suitable for dynamic, rapidly evolving projects where the ease of testing and the flexibility to make quick changes outweigh the need for optimized performance. They are favored in educational environments, scripting, and in situations where programs need to be run across different platforms without modification.

In practice, many modern development environments blend both approaches, using just-in-time (JIT) compilation techniques to combine the development convenience of interpreters with the performance benefits of compilers.
