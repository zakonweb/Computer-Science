Sound is inherently an analog signal—a continuous wave that travels through air. To convert this analog sound into a format that computers can store and process, it must be digitized. This process involves several key steps and concepts including sampling, sampling rate, and sampling resolution. Here’s a breakdown of how sound is represented and encoded in digital form:

Analog and Digital Data
- Analog Data: Sound, in its natural form, is analog. It varies continuously and has an infinite number of possible values at any given time.
- Digital Data: Computers and digital devices store and process data in binary form. Digital sound data is a discrete (non-continuous) representation of the original analog sound wave.

Sampling
Sampling is the process of converting an analog sound signal into a digital one by taking measurements (samples) of the sound wave at regular intervals. Each sample captures the amplitude (volume level) of the audio signal at a specific point in time.

Sampling Rate
The sampling rate, also known as the sampling frequency, is the number of samples taken per second from the analog sound wave. It is measured in Hertz (Hz) or kilohertz (kHz). Common sampling rates include 44.1 kHz (used in CDs), 48 kHz (used in DVDs), and 96 kHz (used for high-resolution audio).

Sampling Resolution
Also known as bit depth, the sampling resolution determines the number of bits used to represent each sample. This affects the precision with which the amplitudes of the sound wave are recorded. Common bit depths are 16 bits (CD quality), 24 bits (professional audio quality), and 32 bits (high dynamic range).

Impact of Changing the Sampling Rate and Resolution

Impact on File Size
- Higher Sampling Rate: Increases the number of samples per second, thereby increasing the file size, as more data is being recorded.
- Higher Sampling Resolution: Increases the number of bits per sample, also leading to larger file sizes, as each sample contains more information.

Impact on Accuracy
- Higher Sampling Rate: Enhances the accuracy with which the sound is captured, particularly its frequency. A higher sampling rate can accurately reproduce higher frequency sounds. According to the Nyquist theorem, to accurately reproduce a sound, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the sound.
- Higher Sampling Resolution: Improves the dynamic range of the recording, allowing for a more precise representation of sound amplitudes. This results in better reproduction of quiet and loud sounds and reduces quantization error (the error introduced when rounding off the amplitude values to the nearest available value due to limited bit depth).

Conclusion
The choice of sampling rate and resolution significantly impacts the quality, accuracy, and size of the digital audio file. Higher rates and resolutions provide better fidelity to the original sound but at the cost of larger file sizes, which can be a consideration for storage and bandwidth usage. Balancing these factors is key in audio recording and playback scenarios, depending on the intended use and the constraints of the playback system or storage medium.
