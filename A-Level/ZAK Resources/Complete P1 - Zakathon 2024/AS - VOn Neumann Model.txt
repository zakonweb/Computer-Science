The Von Neumann model outlines a computer system architecture with four key components: 

the Central Processing Unit (CPU) for processing data, 

a single shared memory unit for storing both data and instructions, 

input devices for data entry, and 

output devices for displaying results. 

This model also introduces the stored program concept, where program instructions are stored in memory alongside data, allowing the CPU to fetch and execute instructions sequentially.
