An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a comprehensive tool that assists programmers in software development with a variety of integrated features. These features are designed to streamline coding, debugging, and testing processes. Here are some typical features found in an IDE:

1. Features for Coding:
   - Context-Sensitive Prompts: IDEs often provide auto-completion features that suggest methods, variables, and other code elements based on the current context. This can speed up coding and reduce errors.
   - Code Templates and Snippets: Predefined templates or snippets for common coding patterns and structures that can be quickly inserted into your code.

2. Features for Initial Error Detection:
   - Dynamic Syntax Checks: The IDE continuously checks your code for syntax errors as you type, highlighting mistakes and sometimes offering suggestions for correction. This immediate feedback helps to catch errors early in the development process.
   - Code Linting: Analyzes code for potential stylistic issues, bugs, and suspicious constructs, which improves code quality and consistency.

3. Features for Presentation:
   - Prettyprint: Automatically formats code according to a specified style guide, making it easier to read and understand by aligning braces, indentations, and other elements.
   - Expand and Collapse Code Blocks: Allows you to hide (collapse) or display (expand) sections of code, which is useful for managing complex files and focusing on specific parts of your code.

4. Features for Debugging:
   - Single Stepping: Lets you execute your program one line or one instruction at a time, providing a way to observe the behavior of your program in detail as it runs.
   - Breakpoints: Allow you to pause the execution of your program at a specified point so you can examine the current state, including variables, computations, and memory usage.
   - Variable Watches and Expression Evaluation: Monitors specific variables or expressions, updating the values in real time as you step through the code. This feature is crucial for tracking how data changes over time during debugging.
   - Report Window: Displays detailed information about the program execution, error messages, debugging outputs, and other diagnostic data that helps in resolving issues.

Overall, IDEs are designed to provide a single environment where developers can write, test, debug, and maintain their code efficiently, reducing the need for multiple disparate tools and enhancing productivity.
