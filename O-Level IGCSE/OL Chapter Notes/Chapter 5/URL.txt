A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a web address used to locate a specific resource on the internet, such as a web page, image, video, or file. It is a standardized way to represent the address of a resource and provides a way to access that resource from anywhere in the world.

A URL consists of several components, including:

Protocol: The protocol specifies the method used to access the resource, such as HTTP or HTTPS.

Domain name: The domain name identifies the specific website or server where the resource is located.

Path: The path specifies the location of the specific resource on the server, such as the file path or the URL of a specific web page.

Resource: The file that is accessed through URL.

For example, the URL for a website is: https://www.zakonweb.com/a/b/main.jpg. Here, the protocol is HTTPS, the domain name is zakonweb.com, and there is specific path /a/b/ specified, indicating that the URL is for the main.jpg image file of the website.

URLs are an essential part of the internet and are used for a wide range of purposes, including accessing websites, downloading files, and sharing information.
