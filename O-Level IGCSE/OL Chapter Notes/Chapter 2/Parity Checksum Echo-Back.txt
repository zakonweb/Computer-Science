(a) Parity Check (Odd and Even)

Parity check is a simple error detection method that involves adding an extra bit (called the parity bit) to the data to ensure that the total number of 1s in the data is either odd (odd parity) or even (even parity). There are two types of parity checks:

i. Parity Byte Check: The parity bit is added to each byte of data. The receiving device checks the parity bit to ensure that the number of 1s is consistent with the selected parity. If not, an error is detected.

ii. Parity Block Check: The parity bits are added to form a parity block that covers an entire block of data. The receiving device checks the parity of the entire block to detect errors.

(b) Checksum

A checksum is a value calculated from the data being transmitted and sent along with the data. The receiving device recalculates the checksum using the same algorithm and compares it to the received checksum. If the calculated checksum does not match the received one, an error is detected.

(c) Echo Check

In an echo check, the receiving device sends the received data back to the sender. The sender compares the echoed data with the original data. If any discrepancies are found, the sender retransmits the data.
