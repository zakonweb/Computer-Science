Data Packets and Packet Switching
(a) Data Packets

To be transmitted, data is broken down into smaller units called packets. A packet of data typically contains the following components:

i. Packet header: This contains information about the packet, such as the destination address, packet number, and originator's address.

ii. Payload: This is the actual data being transmitted.

iii. Trailer: This part contains error-checking information and marks the end of the packet.

(b) Packet Switching

Packet switching is a technique used in data transmission where data is broken down into packets, which are sent independently to their destination. The key features of packet switching include:

i. Data is broken down into packets: This allows for efficient transmission and reduces the impact of errors on the overall data transfer.

ii. Each packet could take a different route: This flexibility helps optimize the network's usage and increases its reliability.

iii. A router controls the route a packet takes: Routers analyze the network and determine the most efficient path for each packet.

iv. Packets may arrive out of order: Due to their independent routing, packets can arrive in a different order than they were sent. However, the packets are reordered at the destination based on their packet numbers.
