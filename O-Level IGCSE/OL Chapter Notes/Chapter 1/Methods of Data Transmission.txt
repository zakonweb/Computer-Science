Methods of Data Transmission
(a) Different Methods of Data Transmission

Data can be transmitted using various methods, including:

i. Serial transmission: In this method, data bits are transmitted one after the other over a single communication channel.

ii. Parallel transmission: Data bits are transmitted simultaneously over multiple communication channels.

iii. Simplex transmission: Data is transmitted in only one direction, from sender to receiver.

iv. Half-duplex transmission: Data can be transmitted in both directions, but not simultaneously. Communication alternates between sending and receiving.

v. Full-duplex transmission: Data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously, allowing for faster communication.

(b) Suitability of Each Method

The choice of a data transmission method depends on the specific scenario and requirements. Some factors to consider include the distance between devices, the required transmission speed, and the available communication channels.
