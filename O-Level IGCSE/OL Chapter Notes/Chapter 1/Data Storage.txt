Data Storage

Understanding Data Storage Measurements:
Data storage is measured using various units, based on binary (powers of 2) or decimal (powers of 10) systems. For this class, we will focus on binary-based units:

Bit: The smallest unit of data storage, representing a single binary digit (0 or 1).
Nibble: A group of 4 bits.
Byte: A group of 8 bits.
Kibibyte (KiB): 1 KiB = 1,024 bytes.
Mebibyte (MiB): 1 MiB = 1,024 KiB.
Gibibyte (GiB): 1 GiB = 1,024 MiB.
Tebibyte (TiB): 1 TiB = 1,024 GiB.
Pebibyte (PiB): 1 PiB = 1,024 TiB.
Exbibyte (EiB): 1 EiB = 1,024 PiB.
These units are used to measure the size of data storage devices or digital files.

Calculating File Size for Image and Sound Files:
Image File Size: To calculate the file size of an uncompressed image, use the formula:

File size (in bytes) = Image Width (pixels) x Image Height (pixels) x Color Depth (bits per pixel) / 8

Convert the file size to the desired units (e.g., KiB, MiB) by dividing by the appropriate power of 1024.

Sound File Size: To calculate the file size of an uncompressed sound file, use the formula:

File size (in bytes) = Sample Rate (samples per second) x Sample Resolution (bits per sample) x Length of Track (seconds) / 8

Convert the file size to the desired units as before.
