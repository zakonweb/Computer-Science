Answer key:
I. Sensors, Microprocessors, and Actuators in Automated Systems
Open-ended questions:

1. The role of sensors in an automated system is to detect and measure physical properties, such as temperature, pressure, light, or sound, and convert these properties into electrical signals that can be interpreted by a microprocessor. An example of a sensor used in a real-world application is a temperature sensor in a smart thermostat system.

2. Microprocessors contribute to the decision-making process in an automated system by processing and analyzing the data received from sensors. They make decisions based on the input data and programmed instructions and send commands to actuators to control the system. An example is the microprocessor in a self-driving car that receives data from various sensors and makes decisions on how the car should navigate and respond to its environment.

3. The function of an actuator in an automated system is to convert the electrical signals from microprocessors into mechanical motion or other actions, such as turning on a light or moving a robotic arm. An example of its use in a real-world scenario is an actuator in a smart thermostat system that adjusts the HVAC system to maintain the desired temperature based on the microprocessor's commands.

Closed-ended questions:

Disadvantages may include high costs for purchasing and maintaining the automated system, reliance on technology that may require specialized knowledge or skills, and potential ethical concerns related to data.

Privacy concerns with lighting automated systems arise mainly due to the collection, storage, and potential misuse of user data. Some of these concerns include:
Data collection: Automated lighting systems often collect data on users' habits, such as when they are home, their preferred lighting settings, and daily routines. This information, if accessed by unauthorized individuals or entities, could potentially compromise users' privacy.

Third-party sharing: Some automated lighting system manufacturers might share collected data with third parties for marketing, analytics, or other purposes. This sharing of personal information can result in unwanted targeted advertising or other breaches of user privacy.

Surveillance and tracking: Advanced automated lighting systems with integrated cameras or motion sensors can potentially be used to track users' movements within their homes or monitor their activities. Unauthorized access to this data could lead to privacy invasions.

Smart home integration: Automated lighting systems are often integrated with other smart home devices, which can be vulnerable to hacking or other cybersecurity threats. If an attacker gains access to a smart home network, they may be able to control lighting settings or gather sensitive information about the occupants, leading to privacy concerns.

Remote access vulnerability: Automated lighting systems can be controlled remotely using smartphones or other devices. If an unauthorized user gains access to the control system, they could manipulate the lighting settings, potentially invading the privacy of the home's occupants.

To address these privacy concerns, it is essential to choose lighting automated systems from reputable manufacturers, implement proper security measures, and practice caution when sharing personal information or granting access to remote control features.
