Database:

1. **Define a single-table database from given data storage requirements**: A single-table database is a database that consists of just one table to store data. It's simpler than a multi-table relational database, but it's also less flexible and can lead to data redundancy. Here are the components:

   - **Fields**: These are the different categories of data that are stored in the table. For example, in a table storing information about books, you might have fields like "Title", "Author", "Publication Date", etc.
   
   - **Records**: These are individual entries in the table. Each record consists of a set of values for the fields. In the books example, each book would be a record.
   
   - **Validation**: This is a set of rules that ensure the data entered into the table is correct and useful. For example, you might have a rule that the "Publication Date" field must be a valid date.

2. **Suggest suitable basic data types**: Here are some common data types and their uses:

   - **Text/alphanumeric**: This is used for fields that contain letters, numbers, and other characters.
   
   - **Character**: This is used for fields that contain single characters.
   
   - **Boolean**: This is used for fields that can have only two values, usually true or false.
   
   - **Integer**: This is used for fields that contain whole numbers.
   
   - **Real**: This is used for fields that contain decimal numbers.
   
   - **Date/time**: This is used for fields that contain dates or times.

3. **Understand the purpose of a primary key and identify a suitable primary key for a given database table**: A primary key is a field that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It must contain a unique value for each record, and it cannot contain null values. For example, in a table of students, the student ID might be a good primary key, as it's unique to each student.

4. **Read, understand and complete structured query language (SQL) scripts to query data stored in a single database table**: SQL is a language used to interact with databases. Here are some basic commands:

   - **SELECT**: This is used to specify the fields that you want to retrieve.
   
   - **FROM**: This is used to specify the table from which to retrieve the data.
   
   - **WHERE**: This is used to filter the records that are retrieved based on some condition.
   
   - **ORDER BY**: This is used to sort the retrieved records based on one or more fields.
   
   - **SUM**: This is used to calculate the total sum of a numeric column.
   
   - **COUNT**: This is used to calculate the number of rows that match a specified criterion.
   
   Identifying the output of an SQL query involves understanding what the query is asking for and knowing the structure and content of the database table. For example, the query `SELECT Author FROM Books WHERE Title = 'Moby Dick';` would return the author of the book titled 'Moby Dick'.
