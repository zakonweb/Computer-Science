Stages of the program development life cycle:

1. **Analysis**: This is the initial stage of a project, where the problem is identified and defined. This involves understanding the requirements of the system or program and the goals it needs to achieve. Key tasks include:

   - **Abstraction**: This involves simplifying the problem by identifying the essential features and ignoring the details. It helps in understanding the problem better and focusing on the main requirements.
   
   - **Decomposition of the problem**: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. This makes it easier to understand and solve the problem.
   
   - **Identification of the problem and requirements**: Identifying what needs to be achieved by the program and what are the specific requirements. This could involve consulting with stakeholders, understanding user needs, and so on.

2. **Design**: In this stage, a detailed plan for how the system or program will work is created. This involves:

   - **Decomposition**: Similar to in the analysis stage, the solution is broken down into smaller, manageable parts.
   
   - **Structure diagrams**: These are used to visually represent the structure of the system, including its components, their relationships, and the flow of control or data.
   
   - **Flowcharts**: These are diagrams that represent the flow of control in the system or program. They show the steps in the process and their order.
   
   - **Pseudocode**: This is a way of writing down the logic of the program in a language that is similar to code but is simpler and easier to understand. It helps in planning how the code will be written.

3. **Coding**: This is the stage where the actual program code is written, based on the design. It involves writing the program code and testing it iteratively. Iterative testing means testing the code as it is written, fixing any issues that arise, and then continuing to write more code. This allows for issues to be caught and fixed early in the process.

4. **Testing**: In this final stage, the complete system or program is tested to make sure it works as expected. This involves:

   - **Testing program code**: This involves running the program with various inputs to see if it produces the expected outputs. This can help identify any errors or issues in the code.
   
   - **Use of test data**: Test data refers to data that is used to test the program. This could be actual data that the program will be working with, or it could be specially created data that is designed to test specific aspects of the program.

Each stage is crucial in its own way and plays a significant role in the successful development of a program. It's important to note that these stages often overlap and iterate, meaning developers may go back and forth between stages as needed.
