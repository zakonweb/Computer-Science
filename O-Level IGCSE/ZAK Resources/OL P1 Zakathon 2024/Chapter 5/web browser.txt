A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view web pages on the internet. The primary function of a web browser is to interpret and render Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and other web programming languages such as CSS and JavaScript, to display web pages on a computer or mobile device.

Apart from rendering HTML, a web browser performs various functions that enhance user experience, including:

1. Storing bookmarks and favorites: Users can save their favorite websites as bookmarks or favorites, making it easier to access them later.

2. Recording user history: Browsers keep a record of the user's browsing history, allowing them to revisit previously visited sites easily.

3. Allowing the use of multiple tabs: Browsers allow users to open multiple web pages in separate tabs, making it easier to switch between them.

4. Storing cookies: Cookies are small text files that websites store on a user's device, allowing them to remember user preferences, login information, and other details.

5. Providing navigation tools: Browsers provide a variety of navigation tools, such as back and forward buttons.

6. Providing an address bar: The address bar allows users to enter the URL or web address of a website they want to visit or search the web for specific information.

In summary, a web browser is a software application that interprets HTML and other web programming languages to display web pages, as well as performing additional functions such as storing bookmarks, recording user history, allowing multiple tabs, storing cookies, providing navigation tools, and an address bar to enhance the user experience while browsing the internet.
