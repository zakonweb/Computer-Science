Blockchain is a digital ledger technology that is used to record and track transactions of digital currencies, as well as other types of data. It is a decentralized system that uses cryptography to create a secure and transparent ledger that is accessible to all participants.

At its core, a blockchain is a time-stamped series of records or blocks, that are linked together using cryptography, forming a chain of blocks. Each block contains a unique code, called a hash, which is created by processing the data in the block through a mathematical algorithm. The hash of each block is also used to link it to the previous block in the chain, creating a chronological record of transactions.

Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, making it an immutable record of all transactions that have taken place. This creates a high level of security and transparency, as all participants in the blockchain network can see the same information and verify the accuracy of the transactions.

In the case of digital currency transactions, each block in the blockchain represents a series of transactions, which are verified by a network of nodes in the blockchain network. When a new transaction is added to the network, it is verified and processed by multiple nodes, and once it is confirmed, it is added to a new block in the chain.

The use of blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we think about digital currency transactions and has created new opportunities for secure, transparent, and decentralized systems of exchange. By providing a transparent and immutable record of all transactions, blockchain technology has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from finance to healthcare, logistics, and beyond.
