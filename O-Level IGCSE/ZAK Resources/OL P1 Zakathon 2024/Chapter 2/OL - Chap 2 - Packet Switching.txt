(c) Process of Packet Switching:

- Breaking Down Data into Packets: Initially, the entire message or data to be sent is divided into smaller, manageable units known as packets. Each packet includes a portion of the data along with its header and trailer.

- Routing of Packets: Each packet can take a different route to the destination, depending on the current network conditions, the capacity of the path, and the decisions made by routers along the way. Routers play a crucial role in controlling the paths that packets take.

- Independent Packet Travel: Since each packet may travel independently and take different paths, they can arrive at the destination in a different order from which they were sent.

- Reordering of Packets: At the destination, there is a process to reorder the packets based on their sequence numbers included in the headers. This ensures that the original data can be accurately reconstructed from the individual packets.

- Completion of Data Transmission: Once all packets have arrived and are reordered, the complete message is reassembled and ready for use by the receiver.

Packet switching offers several key advantages, particularly for digital communications over networks:

1. Efficiency: Packet switching allows the network to use its resources more efficiently. Since packets can be routed independently and can take any available path, the network can handle more data traffic without requiring a dedicated path for each communication.

2. Flexibility: This method provides great flexibility, as it can dynamically route data through the network based on current conditions such as congestion or link failure. This helps in maintaining network performance and reliability.

3. Robustness: Packet switching enhances the robustness of a network. If a particular path is disrupted or overloaded, packets can be rerouted through alternative paths. This ability to adapt to network changes ensures continuous data transfer even in challenging conditions.

4. Scalability: Networks that use packet switching can easily accommodate more connections and higher volumes of data without significant changes to the underlying infrastructure. This scalability makes it ideal for growing and fluctuating network demands.

5. Cost-effectiveness: Since packet-switched networks efficiently manage bandwidth and do not require dedicated circuits for each communication, they are more cost-effective compared to traditional circuit-switched networks.

6. Error handling: The structure of packets includes headers and trailers that can carry information for error detection and correction. This allows the network to identify and fix errors in data transmission, ensuring high data integrity.

These advantages make packet switching a popular choice for data networks, including the Internet.
