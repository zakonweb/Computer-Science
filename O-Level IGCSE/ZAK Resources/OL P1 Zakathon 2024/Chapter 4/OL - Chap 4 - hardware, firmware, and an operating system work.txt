Understanding how hardware, firmware, and an operating system work together to run application software involves recognizing their interdependencies and roles within a computer system. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. Hardware: This is the physical component of a computer system. It includes the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (like HDDs or SSDs), and input/output devices (such as keyboards, mice, and displays). Hardware is the foundational layer upon which all software operates.

2. Firmware: Firmware is a specialized type of software that provides the low-level control for a device's specific hardware. One crucial piece of firmware is the bootloader, which is responsible for initializing the hardware and starting the operating system when the computer boots up. The firmware is typically stored in non-volatile memory chips (such as ROM) and runs directly on the hardware to perform its tasks.

3. Operating System (OS): The operating system is software that acts as an intermediary between application software and the computer hardware. It manages and coordinates the use of the hardware among various application programs. The OS provides critical services such as memory management, task scheduling, and input/output control, thereby creating an environment in which applications can run. The operating system itself is loaded and run by the firmware (specifically, the bootloader) after the initial hardware checks and setups are completed.

4. Application Software: These are programs designed to carry out specific tasks other than just running the computer system. Examples include word processors, web browsers, and database management systems. Application software runs on the operating system, which in turn manages the application's interaction with the hardware via the system's firmware.

Flow of Control:
- Hardware powers up and initializes basic system operations.
- Firmware (bootloader) takes control initially to perform system checks, then loads and starts the operating system.
- Operating System takes over, managing the system’s resources and providing services and an interface for the application software.
- Application Software uses the services provided by the OS to perform functional tasks for the user.

Each layer provides the necessary foundation and support for the next, enabling the seamless functioning of a computer system from hardware up to high-level application software. This structured interaction ensures that the computer is usable for everyday tasks, complex computations, and everything in between.
